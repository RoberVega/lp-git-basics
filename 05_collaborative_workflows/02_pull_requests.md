# Pull Requests (PRs) 📥👀✅

As we venture into the collaborative features of Git, it's crucial to understand the concept of the Pull Request when using GitHub. A Pull Request (PR) is GitHub’s way of streamlining the merging process, encouraging review and discussion before integrating changes.

## What is a Pull Request?

A Pull Request is a request to merge one branch into another, but it comes with a platform for conversation. When you open a PR, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull your contribution into their branch. PRs are a core part of GitHub's collaborative model, giving everyone a chance to contribute to the project discussion before changes are merged.


Pull Requests are not just about merging code; they’re about starting conversations around changes. By incorporating Pull Requests into your workflow, you embrace a collaborative environment that is vital to modern software development.
